# YUNotAllowMultipleKeybinds
Minecraft mod I wrote out of frustration that stops Minecraft from disabling keys when they are bound to more than one thing, useful for large modpacks

This mod is only updated when I need it to be updated so don't bother me with complains about not supporting 1.12 or whatever. Not enough mods have been ported yet anyway for a 1.12/1.11/1.10/1.9/1.8 modpack to be substantial anyway
